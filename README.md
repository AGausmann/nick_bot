# IRCBot

IRCBot.java is a simple IRC bot library I made so as to help making IRC bots easier for users. The IRC bot library, however, does not house a "keep alive" block. That block is stored in the bot.java.

I use Properties to import variables I need from the settings.properties file and set such variables to the IRCBot using my setter method.

Note: Currently this bot works only if you have a registered account, because authentication is a pain.
